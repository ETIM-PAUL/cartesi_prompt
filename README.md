#### Cartesi Ask

This project is built using OpenAI Assistant and finetuned models, React Vite, Tailwind and deployed on vercel. Currently, it retrieves information/code from the cartesi docs. But we aim to build upon it for generating code and how to set up for project ideas to be build on the cartesi machine, by crawling public github repos that contain codes similar to the query asked.

Text query and voice query can be carry out for information retrieval.

#### Aim and Objective of Cartesi Ask

We aim to help developers by combining the power of Artifical Inteligence, Github repo crawling feature and Code retrieval to help make development easy. Also, as more queries are made, this models will be trained to provide more specific and current information. It is extended to also give replies to query concerning programming langauges like javascript, typescript and rust.
